	* lib/gpx/gpx.rb, lib/gpx/point.rb, lib/gpx/route.rb,
	  lib/gpx/waypoint.rb: Thanks to Mike Gauland for discovering some
	  route- and waypoint-related bugs. I've fixed them and also added
	  #to_s on Waypoint so it's easier to debug.

	* lib/gpx/gpx_file.rb, tests/gpx_file_test.rb: Another patch from
	  Gaku Ueda. This one allows you to pass in a string of GPX
	  data using the :gpx_date => option. Thanks Gaku!

	* lib/gpx/gpx.rb: Updating the version #.

2007-11-30 06:26  dougfales

	* lib/gpx/gpx.rb, lib/gpx/gpx_file.rb, lib/gpx/point.rb,
	  lib/gpx/route.rb, lib/gpx/segment.rb, lib/gpx/track.rb,

	  namespace parsing
	  was hard-coded to 1.1. previously).
	  * Adding a GPX 1.0 unit test file.
	  * Miscellaneous updates to make it work with Ruby 1.8.6.

	  lib/gpx/segment.rb, lib/gpx/track.rb, lib/gpx/waypoint.rb,
	  tests/segment_test.rb: First stab at using libxml-ruby instead of
	  REXML. I'm seeing the unit tests
	  finish in under 14 seconds. That is compared to 2 minutes using
	  REXML.

2006-12-03 07:31  dougfales

	* lib/gpx/point.rb, lib/gpx/segment.rb: Fixing more nil time
	  exceptions.

	* lib/gpx/segment.rb: Fixing an exception in contains_time?.

2006-11-28 15:35  dougfales

	* lib/gpx/bounds.rb, lib/gpx/gpx_file.rb: A couple of fixes to make
	  the library comply with the different attribute names
	  possible on the bounds element.
	  
	  Formerly, a bounds element with a minlat or minLat attribute
	  (instead of
	  min_lat) would not be properly parsed. Now all three styles of
	  attribute name
	  are accepted.
